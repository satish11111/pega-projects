A typical hotel management project, various aspects of managing a hotel's operations efficiently. Here's a general summary of what such a project could involve:

1. **Reservation Management**: The system would include features for managing room reservations, such as checking availability, making bookings, modifying or canceling reservations, and handling special requests.

2. **Guest Check-In/Check-Out**: There would be functionalities for facilitating the check-in and check-out processes, including guest registration, assigning rooms, collecting payment information, and generating invoices.

3. **Room Management**: The system would allow hotel staff to manage room inventory, track room statuses (clean, occupied, vacant, etc.), and assign specific rooms based on guest preferences and requirements.


4. **Guest Services**: There could be functionalities for managing guest services, such as room service requests, concierge assistance, transportation arrangements, and handling guest feedback or complaints.

5. **Reporting and Analytics**: The system may provide tools for generating reports and analyzing data related to occupancy rates, revenue, guest preferences, and other key metrics to help hotel management make informed decisions.

6. **Security and Access Control**: Given the importance of guest privacy and security, the system would likely include features to ensure data protection, access control measures, and compliance with relevant regulations (such as GDPR for European hotels).

7. **Integration and Scalability**: Depending on the hotel's requirements, the system may need to integrate with other systems such as property management systems (PMS), channel managers, and online booking platforms. It should also be designed to scale as the hotel grows or additional features are needed.

This summary provides a broad overview, and the specific features and functionalities of a hotel management project may vary depending on factors such as the size of the hotel, its target market, and the technology stack being used.

To enhance the functionality of the hotel management system, we can introduce a new data object tailored for rooms. This new data object allows seamless insertion of room-related data into the database. We achieve this by creating properties that reference data, thereby mapping values efficiently.
